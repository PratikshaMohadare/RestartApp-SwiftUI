*1. ADVANCED APP DESIGN*

The main goal of this mini-project is to see what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework.

*2. COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES*

Created custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library.

*3. PARALLAX EFFECT*

By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect), we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.
